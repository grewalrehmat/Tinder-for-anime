# **Tinder for Anime**

Welcome to the **Tinder for Anime** project, where users can swipe through anime characters and rate their preferences with a simple "Like" or "Dislike" action. This web app is built using Django for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.

## **Features**

- **Swipeable Anime Cards**: The app displays anime cards, and users can swipe right to "Like" or left to "Dislike" characters.
- **Anime Details**: Each card contains the anime character's image, name, and description.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Interactive Swipe Animation**: Cards animate smoothly when swiped.
- **Data Persistence** (Optional): The user's swipe history (Likes/Dislikes) can be saved for personalized recommendations.

## **Tech Stack**

- **Backend**: Django (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database**: SQLite (or any preferred database)
- **Template Engine**: Django Template Language (DTL)

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

Before running the app, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python** (>= 3.8)
- **Django** (>= 3.0)
- **Node.js** (Optional for front-end build process)

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tinder-for-anime.git
   cd tinder-for-anime
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   Install Python dependencies using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up the database**:

   Run the migrations to set up the database schema:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Run the development server**:

   Start the Django development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   The app should now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser.

### **Adding Anime Data**

- The anime data can be added manually through the Django admin interface or using a custom script.
- You can add fields like `name`, `description`, and `image_url` for each anime character to populate the cards.

### **Frontend Files**

- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file where the anime cards are rendered. This file uses Django template tags to display dynamic data passed from the backend.
- **`style.css`**: The CSS file that defines the layout, swipe animations, and UI design.
- **JavaScript**: The script that handles the swipe functionality, using mouse or touch events to detect swipe direction and animate the cards.

### **Backend Files**

- **`models.py`**: Contains the `Anime` model, which stores the data for each anime character.
- **`views.py`**: Defines the views that handle rendering anime cards to the template and processing user interactions.
- **`urls.py`**: Defines the URL routes for the app.

## **Usage**

Once the app is set up, you can navigate through the anime cards by swiping left or right.

- **Swipe Right**: "Like" the anime.
- **Swipe Left**: "Dislike" the anime.
- **Saving Likes/Dislikes**: This feature can be integrated with AJAX requests to save user preferences in the database, allowing for personalized recommendations.

### **Customizing the Anime Data**

You can modify the anime data in the Django admin interface or add more fields to the `Anime` model if you want additional information on each card.

To access the admin interface:

1. Create a superuser:

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

2. Log in at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` and start adding anime data.

## **Possible Improvements**

- **Backend Integration**: Connect the app to a database to save and retrieve user interactions (Likes/Dislikes).
- **Anime Recommendations**: Based on user preferences, recommend similar anime characters or series.
- **User Authentication**: Allow users to log in and track their swipe history.
